# Chat-App-using-Java-Swing

- This application is totally built using the Java language and its Swing library for GUI
- In this application I have tried to make functionality such that peoples connecting to the same LAN can chat from one computer to onother computer.
- I have just used java.net library which is provided by default by the java language.
- I have made a Server class and a Client class
- These two classes will work as the chat recepients between two computers.
- All the improvement to this project and code is cordially invited.
- Till Now only Server GUI is completed and I have to work on the Client GUI.
- Thank You.
